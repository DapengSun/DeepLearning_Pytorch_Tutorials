#######过拟合和欠拟合

#1.例子1：线性：房价

#2.例子2：非线性：GPA

#3.数据分布
###that's is perfect if known
###其他因素：noise

#4.let's assume

#5.Mismatch:ground-truth vs estmiated
####model capacity

#6.情况1，estimated < 真实值  ----->  under-fitting
###train　acc. is bad
###test acc. is bad as well
#######增加模型复杂度
#  情况2，estimated > 真实值  ----->  over-fitting
###train loss and acc. is much better
###test acc. is worse
###==>泛化能力

#7,overfitting多(数据集足够多)
###how to test

###how to reduce
